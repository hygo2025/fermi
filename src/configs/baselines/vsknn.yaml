# V-SKNN (Vector Session-based KNN)
# Session-based KNN with vector-based similarity

model: VSKNN

# KNN Parameters
k: 500                    # Number of nearest neighbors
sample_size: 5000         # Sample size for efficiency (0 = use all sessions)
similarity: cosine        # Similarity function (cosine, jaccard)

# Weighting schemes
weighting: div            # Position weight for current session (same, div, linear, log, quadratic)
weighting_score: div      # Score decay for neighbor items (same, div, linear, log, quadratic)
normalize: true           # Normalize final scores

# No training epochs needed (non-parametric)
epochs: 1
train_batch_size: 4096
eval_batch_size: 4096

# Early stopping disabled for KNN
stopping_step: 1000
